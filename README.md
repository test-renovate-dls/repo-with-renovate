# repo_with_renovate



This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

PyPI            | `pip install repo-with-renovate`

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from repo_with_renovate import __version__

print(f"Hello repo_with_renovate {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m repo_with_renovate --version
```
